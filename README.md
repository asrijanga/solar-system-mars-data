# Mars terrain for the solar-system app

The terrain the app at <https://asrijanga.github.io/solar-system/> streams for Mars: quantized-mesh tiles, levels 0–7, with vertices 1.31 km apart at level 7. They live here because Mars needs its own GitHub Pages site and its own 1 GB (owner, 2026-10-02).

Nothing in this repository is edited by hand. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` builds the tiles from the app repository, at the commit named in `SOURCE`, and deploys them. How they are made, and every check, is in the app repository's `docs/stories/SS-14.md` (W4).
